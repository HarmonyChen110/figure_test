First, existing extraction devices (MPSS, elutriation columns, SMI units, etc.) are criticized for being complex, requiring special customization (high processing costs), involving multiple operational steps (labor-intensive and time-consuming), and requiring large volumes of flotation liquid (high operational costs with environmental challenges). Second, the paper highlights limitations in flotation liquid selection, noting that lower density liquids like distilled water cannot extract high-density microplastics, and emphasizes the need to balance environmental impact against operational costs. These challenges led the authors to develop a new simplified device using NaBr solution that addresses these limitations through common laboratory instruments, reusability, and environmental friendliness."

The authors highlight clogging problems in existing conical glass separating funnels with taps, noting that the 0.2 cm pore size opening causes frequent clogging that makes manipulation difficult (C1). This clogging also results in disturbance of sediments after settling, making microplastic separation harder (C2). The paper also identifies high instrument costs (C4) and contamination risks from plastic components (C3) as limitations of existing equipment. Additionally, the authors note that recovery efficiency may be sediment-dependent, requiring consideration of diverse substrates in future studies (C5). The researchers address these challenges by modifying glass separating funnels with silicone tubes and Mohr clamps, which mitigated clogging problems and achieved a 90% recovery rate in their experiments."

The primary challenge is the lack of standardized procedures across studies, which creates huge variation in sampling, processing, and characterization methodologies and hinders comparison between reports. Specifically, there is a lack of standardization in methodology and unit expression in sediment microplastic studies. Additionally, the paper notes that only 30% of recent publications included chemical characterization of identified plastic particles. Visual sorting alone is insufficient as it can lead to mis-, over-, or underestimations of plastic particles, requiring further characterization for accurate assessment. These challenges highlight the need for standardized protocols and more comprehensive analytical approaches in MNP research."

In pre-treatment and digestion, NaCl extraction has density limitations (1.2 g/cm³) restricting it to lower density MPs like PP and PE. ZnCl2 extraction is problematic due to corrosion and the requirement for additional acid solution that hinders the process. Matrix interference from inorganic substances and organic matter generally complicates extraction. For identification and quantification, Raman spectroscopy is time-consuming and susceptible to fluorescence interference from soil organic matter. FT-IR has size limitations (only suitable for MPs >20 μm) and organic matter interference. Fourier Transform Infrared Microspectroscopy, while enabling batch identification, has high cost limitations that reduce its popularity. The paper explicitly notes these limitations in its introduction section, justifying the development of a new fluorescence staining-based image recognition method to address these challenges."

In the Separation & Filtration stage, direct decanting of supernatant was found to be unsuccessful as microplastics adhered to container walls. Centrifugation risks fragmenting microplastics, while overflow methods may cause spillage and contamination. Separation funnels were ineffective with biosolids due to particulate matter adhering to glassware. The SMI unit had not been previously used with complex organic matrices. In Pre-treatment & Digestion, mechanical milling techniques risk fragmenting microplastics, making digestion necessary to release trapped particles without damaging them. The paper provides a critical assessment of these methodological limitations in extracting microplastics from solid matrices."

The lack of a gold standard for characterization and quantification (Quality Assurance & Control) is explicitly stated as a fundamental limitation. The diversity of polymer types and environmental matrices creates significant challenges in pre-treatment and digestion phases. Sample type variability (water, sediment, soil, tissue, blood) necessitates different sampling methodologies, impacting representativeness. Critical quality assurance issues include the early development of method standardization and resulting significant variability in concentration measurements across studies (differing by several orders of magnitude), making comparative analysis difficult. These challenges highlight the urgent need for standardized methodologies to support effective microplastic pollution monitoring and regulation."

During sample processing for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization, the researchers found that fine soil particles adhered to BDMP fragments and could not be removed without physical abrasion that would alter the BDMPs' appearance or physical properties. This limitation prevented accurate measurement of post-incubation surface area per weight of BDMPs and estimation of degradation over the incubation period, forcing the researchers to rely on qualitative analysis instead. This challenge highlights the difficulty in isolating microplastics from soil matrices without damaging the samples, which is a significant constraint in accurately assessing BDMP degradation in soil environments."

The authors emphasize significant instrumental variation between different handheld spectrometers, with key characteristics such as wavelength range, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio varying substantially between devices. This variation directly impacts analytical performance, with only certain instruments like FT-based devices providing accurate results. The ability to discriminate polymer types is strongly dependent on each sensor's specific spectral characteristics, creating challenges for consistent identification. The study reveals that the differences between benchtop and handheld instruments have not been adequately characterized, and the impact of instrument-specific characteristics on discriminant capacity remains uninvestigated. Additionally, the paper highlights soil's inherent complexity as a challenging matrix for microplastic analysis due to its heterogeneity, complex composition, and organic matter content, which interferes with extraction and analysis processes. These challenges underscore the need for careful sensor selection and standardization in developing portable NIR spectroscopy methods for environmental monitoring of microplastics."

The density separation method (a common extraction technique) cannot separate high-density microplastics as heavy particles divide with soil components in the same phase. The oil extraction technique, while facilitating extraction, limits further identification due to persistent oil traces. Most critically, quality assurance protocols show significant deficiencies, with negative controls receiving the lowest average score (0.89) among 11 evaluated criteria, while sample size and data reporting scored highest (2.0). The total average score across all criteria was 1.56, indicating substantial room for improvement in methodological quality assurance for soil microplastic studies. The paper strongly recommends that future studies must methodically include QA/QC protocols at every analytical stage to produce reliable data for risk assessment."

Visual sorting shows high error rates (20-70%) and cannot detect small particles (<50 μm). FTIR spectroscopy cannot analyze wet samples and is affected by light scattering from irregular particles. vis-NIR has low precision (10 g kg^-1) and detection limits (15 g kg^-1). Raman spectroscopy suffers from background fluorescence interference and low signal-to-noise ratio. Hyperspectral imaging is limited to particles 0.5-5 mm in size, cannot reach deeper soil layers, and has high costs. All limitations are explicitly documented in Section 5.2 with high confidence scores (90-95), indicating the paper provides a robust critical assessment of methodological constraints in terrestrial MNP analysis."
